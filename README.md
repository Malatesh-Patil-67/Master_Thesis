3D Pose-based action recognition has emerged as a critical field in computer vision. It involves the identification of human actions from three-dimensional skeletal motion data.

This thesis aims to leverage the PoseFormerV2 model architecture [(https://github.com/QitaoZhao/PoseFormerV2)] for this task. We aim to conduct extensive experiments on diverse datasets to evaluate the model’s performance. 

The model is evaluated on two benchmark datasets, N-UCLA and MSR Ac- tion3D, which are known for their complexity in action recognition challenges. Additionally, we use t-SNE visualization to analyze the learned embeddings, providing insights into the model’s ability to effectively differentiate between diverse actions.
