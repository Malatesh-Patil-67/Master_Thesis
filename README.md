3D Pose-based action recognition has emerged as a critical field in computer vision. It involves the identification of human actions from three-dimensional skeletal motion data. This thesis aims to leverage the PoseFormerV2 model architecture [17] for this task. We aim to con- duct extensive experiments on diverse datasets to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance. The goal is to assess its effectiveness and compare results with state-of-the-art action recognition models, thereby advancing our understanding of 3D Pose-based action recognition.
